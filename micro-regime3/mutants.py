"""The mutants of this directory: each check broken on purpose, and caught.

Read by `selftest-mutants.py .`, which copies the tracked files to a temp
directory, applies each mutant there and requires its judge to FAIL on it;
a mutant whose anchor has moved is LOST, not caught. These are the
non-vacuity proofs that used to be dated sentences in docstrings -- "all
three broken deliberately, 2026-08-17" -- which expire the moment the code
under them moves, with nothing to say so. The judges read the runs on disk
through `CORPUS`, since the copy holds tracked files alone; with no run on
disk a judge's baseline is red and its mutants are LOST, which is the honest
reading of a check that needs a run.
