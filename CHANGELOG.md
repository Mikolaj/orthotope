#### 0.1.1.0

- Remove toArrayG function and add some documentation

#### 0.1.8.0

- Various bugfixes, speedups and the new internal operations toVectorListT and toUnorderedVectorListT

#### 0.1.9.0

- Bugfixes, stricter checks of arguments, normalize copying an array out of a larger vector, a default for vFromListN, rotate in DynamicU, a boxed outer array in RankedU and ShapedU ravel and unravel, fewer constraints on iota, Ranked normalize and RankedS.foldrA, and the new internal operations normalizeT, readRangeT and dropBroadcastT
- convertE's Left messages name convert, as in "convert: rank mismatch"; allSameA of a broadcast NaN is False, and of a boxed broadcast of an undefined element fails, as allSame of its list does; and iota converts each index to the element type rather than counting in that type, so for Word8 past 255 it gives as many elements as its shape, wrapped, and for Float past 2^24 the nearest value to each index
